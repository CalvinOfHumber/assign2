To view my project click on the .html file.
As many types berries are red i decided to make red my main color.
I added a white hover for the name of each section and a red one with my links for oranization.
A color animation was used on my header to catch the users attention for an intruduction of my webpage through my title.
Transistions were used on my paragraphs to make it more exciting for the user to experience.
Imagines of the different berries were added to they're sections to insure users understand incase they can't read or if they haven't heard.
